# SendEmail-2

In this project I have developed an email sending application which basically email the user that yes you have successfully registered/applied.
ex: User regitered his/her details on website now details like : name,eamil-id,etc immediately after registering/applying on that website (say webiste is for appplying for any job role) 
an email will be sent (kind of Confirmation Email) that yes! you have successfully registered/applied for this role.

in previous sendEmail project,
I just developed an application in which we already know the receiver emai-id.
But in this Project details are consumed from front-end(website).
