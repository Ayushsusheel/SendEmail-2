# SendEmail-2

In this project I have developed an email sending application which basically email the user that yes you have successfully registered/applied.
ex: User regitered his/her details on website now details like : name,eamil-id,etc immediately after registering/applying on that website (say webiste is for appplying for any job role) 
an email will be sent (kind of Confirmation Email) that yes! you have successfully registered/applied for this role.

in previous sendEmail project,
I just developed an application in which we already know the receiver emai-id.
But in this Project details are consumed from front-end(website).

This is the backend part firslty deploy your project in heroku(any other we also we can use)then after hosting your application on heroku you will get the link/url as:
https://spring-boot-email-application.herokuapp.com/ 
after the endpoint /hello or /mail/send you can see the details.
Connect this url(yours when hosted)with the front-end then according to user's need change the code and if confirmation email has to be sent then you can take reference from this.
